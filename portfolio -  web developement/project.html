    <p>I developed a cross-platform quiz application using 
        <b><i>Flutter</i></b> and <b><i>Dart</i></b> in collaboration with my team as part
        of a project for my college tech event. The app features
        multiple-choice questions stored in a local <i>SQLite</i> database,
        allowing for efficient data retrieval and offline functionality.
        Key features include real-time score tracking and a results
        summary screen. We focused on creating a clean, user-friendly
        interface and smooth performance across devices. This project 
        strengthened my skills in Flutter widget composition, state management, 
        and local database integration. Collaborating as a team helped me 
        improve my communication, version control (Git), and task coordination
        abilities. Future enhancements include user profiles, admin question
        upload, and Firebase-based analytics.</p>
