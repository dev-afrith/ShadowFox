        <p>   During my internship at ShadowFox, I contributed to Python-based <br>development  tasks, focusing on writing efficient, modular code <br> and collaborating with the team to build scalable backend features.<br> This experience deepened  my understanding of real-world software <br> development workflows, version control, and debugging practices.<br> You can view my contributions and sample code from the internship on <br><a href="https://github.com/dev-afrith/ShadowFox" target="_blank" class="git" ><strong><u> &nbsp;Github&nbsp; </u> </strong></a>.</p>
